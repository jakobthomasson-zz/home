1. SCOPE 
1.1 This standard covers the coding system and fabrication dimensions for plain and sleeved, 
carbon and alloy steel anchor bolt assemblies. 
1.2 Basically, anchor bolt for static equipment (vessel, heat exchanger, furnace, etc.) to be 
selected from this standard. Anchor bolt for rotating equipment and others can be applied the 
Vendor’s standard anchor bolt which subject to the Purchaser’s approval. 
This is applied to packaged equipment also. 
1.3. Steel bolt assemblies include the following assembly types (Table I): 
 Carbon Steel - 
Sleeved 
Carbon Steel – 
Non Sleeved 
Standard Length  
(in accordance with 
Table 1) 
A B 
Non-Standard Length 
Details to be provided for non standard 
bolts 
1.4 Table I gives the standard dimensions for the various types of anchor bolt assemblies. 
The length of anchor bolt to be verified by Supplier, in case of using standard dimensions. 
1.5 Table I gives the standard dimensions for the various types of anchor bolt assemblies. The 
projection of the anchor bolt “P” is based on the thickness of the plate, the grout and the 
number of nuts to be installed. For the installation of equipment the anchor bolt projection 
must take into account, the required anchorage detail of the equipment (i.e. the height of the 
skirt, etc.). For the structural steelwork, the projection dimension “P” should be rationalised, to 
allow the fabrication of a particular typed diameter with a defined standard projection. 
1.6 All assemblies shall have threaded lengths equal to the projection, "P". 
1.7 For Alloy steel anchor bolts, the length of anchor bolt to be calculated by Supplier as per 
standard (JPI, ACI, etc.) and the specific requirements are to be clearly noted on the 
individual construction drawings. The condition of reinforced concrete is the followings. 
- Specified compressive strength of concrete for design base : Min. 20 N/mm2 (at 28 days, by 
cylinder test) 
2. ANCHOR BOLTS 
2.1 The anchor bolt information shown on the drawings or on the requisition will give the total 
number of anchor bolts per each bolt code.

2.2 Type of anchor bolt to be selected as following conditions; 
Type A: Horizontal static equipment or Vertical static equipment without template 
Type B: Vertical static equipment with template 
2.3 In case B.C.D. of anchor bolt exceeds 3,000mm or bolt diameter is larger than 36mm, 
template to be supplied and delivered to site with anchor bolt. Shipment schedule for anchor 
bolt and template to be agreed with Purchaser. 
2.4 Anchor bolts assemblies shall be fabricated in accordance with the details and dimensions 
specified within this document. 
2.5 Sleeves shall be of steel pipe or rolled from steel sheet, 2mm minimum thickness for bolts up 
to 36mm diameter, and 2.6mm minimum thickness for bolts 42mm diameter and over. 
2.6 The number and size of tack welds required at each location shall be in accordance with the 
attached figures.  Care shall be taken to ensure that the strength of the bolt is not impaired 
where welds occur on bolt shanks. 
2.7 Each assembly shall be transported fully assembled, i.e. with nuts attached to the bolts and 
washers in place, threads cleaned and oiled. 
2.8 Each assembly shall be identified by die stamping its identification mark on the top of the bolt, 
prior to galvanizing or a metal tag tied to the bolt with soft iron binding wire. 
2.9 All anchor bolt assemblies are to be hot-dip galvanized, in accordance with ASTM 153. 
2.10 Cold temperature anchor bolts material shall be SA320-L43 to ASTM A320/A320M.  Cold 
temperature nuts material shall be SA194 Gr 4 or 7 to ASTM A194/A194M.  Cold 
temperature anchor/washer plate material shall be supplied as specified on the relevant 
equipment drawing, material specification SA240-TP 304 to ASTM A240.  Where Alloy steel 
anchor bolts are required they are to be clearly indicated on the construction drawings, along 
with any other special instructions. 
2.11 Anchor bolts shall be identified by the code below, prefixed by “M” indicating ISO Metric: 
 
M       
 
 
 
Bolt Diameter “d” mm 
  
 
Bolt Type (from Table 1)  
  
 
Bolt Projection "P" in cm.

 Examples: 
 
 M36A15 = 36mm diameter bolt, Type A with 15cm projection 
 
 M20B10 = 20mm diameter bolt, Type B with 10cm projection. 
 
Where Alloy steel anchor bolts are required the bolt type ref shall be increased to a 2 letter 
reference with an additional letter “A” being added to the front of the bolt type reference.  These 
must be clearly indicated on the construction drawing. 
 
Example: 
 
AA  = Alloy steel anchor bolt, Type A 
 
2.12 Drill anchors shall be used only for the parts where neither tensile force nor shearing force 
acts. 
2.13 Chemical anchors shall be used for the parts where tensile force and/ or shearing force acts.
